Combat System Questions:

    * Mobile-Friendly?
    * Options:

        * Turn-based grid combat a la tactics rpg
        * Turn-based static combat a la jrpg
        * Real-time positional combat (networking?)

Combat Damage:

    * All attacks deal a (possibly empty) series of damage to both enemy and
      self
    * Each of those damages has an associated type, to which the target may
      have some form of resistance.
    * Each of those damages also has a pierce percentage, which determines how
      effective those resistances are.
    * Attacks may also have a set of probabilities to inflict corresponding
      statuses.

Scaling Functions:

    * Zero        = amount
    * Linear      = amount + multi * stat
    * Exponential = amount + sign(multi) * (stat/200)^(abs(multi))
    * Logarithmic = amount + sign(multi) * (stat)^(abs(1/multi))
