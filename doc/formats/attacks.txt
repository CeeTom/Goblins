Attacks are stored one per file in the following format:

    8-byte header:          "ATTACK" + 2 zeros (reserved for versioning)
    uint8:                  Scale Stat Id
    float32:                Scale Multi
    float32:                Variance
    uint16:                 Damages Count
    Damages Count * $:      Damages
    uint16:                 Self Damages Count
    Self Damages Count * $: Self Damages
    uint16:                 Name Byte Length
    Name Length * uint8:    Name

where a "Damage" is in the following format:

    uint8:                  Damage Type
    int32:                  Damage
    float32:                Pierce
    uint16:                 Status Count
    Status Count * 5:       Statuses

and a "Status" is in the following format:

    uint8:                  Status Id
    float32:                Probability
